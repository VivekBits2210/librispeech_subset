1993-147149-0000,how infinite the wealth of love and hope garnered in these same tiny treasure houses and oh
1993-147149-0001,what bankrupts in the world we feel when death like some remorseless creditor seizes on all we fondly thought our own the twins
1993-147149-0002,the ghoul like fever was not to be braved with impunity and baulked of its prey
1993-147149-0003,the board not so formidable as she had imagined had inquired into her case and instead of sending her to stoke claypole her husband's buckinghamshire parish as she had dreaded had agreed to pay her rent
1993-147149-0004,margaret met jem wilson several days after his brothers were seriously ill and heard from him the state of things at his home
1993-147149-0005,she stopped with her hand on the latch of the wilsons door to still her beating heart and listened to the hushed quiet within
1993-147149-0006,she opened the door softly there sat missus wilson in the old rocking chair with one sick death like boy lying on her knee crying without let or pause but softly gently as fearing to disturb the troubled gasping child while behind her old alice let her fast dropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin which she was laying out on a board placed on a sort of sofa settee in a corner of the room
1993-147149-0007,over the child which yet breathed the father bent watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none
1993-147149-0008,is there any chance for the other one think you
1993-147149-0009,but earnest as the father was in watching the yet living he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead and sprang gently up and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him
1993-147149-0010,wishing him said mary in a tone of inquiry
1993-147149-0011,then the mother lifted up her voice and wept
1993-147149-0012,her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers
1993-147149-0013,mary and alice drew near the fire and stood in quiet sorrow for some time
1993-147149-0014,then alice broke the silence by saying
1993-147149-0015,afore christmas time i was as full as full could be of going home for good and all yo han heard how i've wished it this terrible long time
1993-147149-0016,but he stayed long there and at last his sturdy frame shook with his strong agony
1993-147149-0017,oh jem don't give way so i cannot bear to see you
1993-147149-0018,he did not speak as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment when her soft hand's touch thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear
1993-147149-0019,don't jem please don't whispered she again believing that his silence was only another form of grief
1993-147149-0020,mary i almost loathe myself when i feel i would not give up this minute when my brothers lie dead and father and mother are in such trouble for all my life that's past and gone and mary as she tried to release her hand you know what makes me feel so blessed
1993-147149-0021,he remained up stairs until after the early dawn showed mary that she need have no fear of going home through the deserted and quiet streets to try and get a little sleep before work hour
1993-147149-0022,so leaving kind messages to george and jane wilson and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to jem and deciding that she had better not she stepped out into the bright morning light so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been
1993-147149-0023,her thoughts ran on jem's manner and words not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day but still she wished he had not put it so plainly
1993-147149-0024,i cannot think what possesses me that i must always be wanting to comfort him when he's downcast and that i must go meddling wi him to night when sure enough it was his aunt's place to speak to him
1993-147149-0025,i think i cannot go right for i either check myself till i'm downright cross to him or else i speak just natural and that's too kind and tender by half
1993-147149-0026,but will he thank me for it
1993-147149-0027,there was something of keen practical shrewdness about her which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple foolish unworldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which miss simmonds young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other yes
1993-147149-0028,the old leaven infused years ago by her aunt esther fermented in her little bosom and perhaps all the more for her father's aversion to the rich and the gentle
1993-147149-0029,it was a comfort to her when scolded by miss simmonds to think of the day when she would drive up to the door in her own carriage to order her gowns from the hasty tempered yet kind dressmaker
1993-147149-0030,but the best of her plans the holiest that which in some measure redeemed the vanity of the rest were those relating to her father her dear father now oppressed with care and always a disheartened gloomy person
1993-147964-0000,they sat about the house most of the day as if it were sunday greasing their boots mending their suspenders plaiting whiplashes
1993-147964-0001,anyway he would never allow one of his horses to be put to such a strain
1993-147964-0002,i had wanted to get some picture books for yulka and antonia even yulka was able to read a little now
1993-147964-0003,she cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book
1993-147964-0004,on the white pages i grouped sunday school cards and advertising cards which i had brought from my old country
1993-147964-0005,when he mounted his horse at the door i saw that he had a hatchet slung to his belt and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me
1993-147964-0006,i put on my cap and ran out to meet jake
1993-147964-0007,he used to help my father cut christmas trees for me in virginia and he had not forgotten how much i liked them
1993-147964-0008,by the time we had placed the cold fresh smelling little tree in a corner of the sitting room it was already christmas eve
1993-147964-0009,from under the lining he now produced a collection of brilliantly colored paper figures several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone
1993-147964-0010,i can see them now exactly as they looked working about the table in the lamplight jake with his heavy features so rudely moulded that his face seemed somehow unfinished otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted mustache
1993-147965-0000,grandfather came down wearing a white shirt and his sunday coat
1993-147965-0001,morning prayers were longer than usual
1993-147965-0002,he gave thanks for our food and comfort and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us
1993-147965-0003,because he talked so little his words had a peculiar force they were not worn dull from constant use
1993-147965-0004,all afternoon he sat in the dining room
1993-147965-0005,at about four o'clock a visitor appeared mister shimerda wearing his rabbit skin cap and collar and new mittens his wife had knitted
1993-147965-0006,he sat still and passive his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair his hands relaxed upon the arms
1993-147965-0007,his face had a look of weariness and pleasure like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain
1993-147965-0008,he made the sign of the cross over me put on his cap and went off in the dark
1993-147966-0000,the week following christmas brought in a thaw and by new year's day all the world about us was a broth of gray slush and the guttered slope between the windmill and the barn was running black water
1993-147966-0001,it was the first time missus shimerda had been to our house and she ran about examining our carpets and curtains and furniture all the while commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious complaining tone
1993-147966-0002,your mama i said angrily wants other people's things
1993-147966-0003,for ambrosch my mama come here
1993-147966-0004,but you see a body never knows what traits poverty might bring out in em
1993-147966-0005,they began to laugh boisterously when they saw me calling
1993-147966-0006,you've got a birthday present this time jim and no mistake
2086-149214-0000,the narrative it may be is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment
2086-149214-0001,in good faith however he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind
2086-149214-0002,the author has considered it hardly worth his while therefore relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rod or rather as by sticking a pin through a butterfly thus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude
2086-149214-0003,if permitted by the historical connection which though slight was essential to his plan the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
2086-149214-0004,he trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending by laying out a street that infringes upon nobody's private rights and appropriating a lot of land which had no visible owner and building a house of materials long in use for constructing castles in the air
2086-149220-0000,the enclosure had formerly been very extensive but was now contracted within small compass and hemmed about partly by high wooden fences and partly by the outbuildings of houses that stood on another street
2086-149220-0001,the white double rosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement of the season and a pear tree and three damson trees which except a row of currant bushes constituted the only varieties of fruit bore marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs
2086-149220-0002,there were also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers in no very flourishing condition but scrupulously weeded as if some person either out of love or curiosity had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they were capable of attaining
2086-149220-0003,summer squashes almost in their golden blossom cucumbers now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock and ramble far and wide two or three rows of string beans and as many more that were about to festoon themselves on poles tomatoes occupying a site so sheltered and sunny that the plants were already gigantic and promised an early and abundant harvest
2086-149220-0004,phoebe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planted these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly
2086-149220-0005,bees too strange to say had thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives beside some farm house miles away
2086-149220-0006,this was a fountain set round with a rim of old mossy stones and paved in its bed with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic work of variously colored pebbles
2086-149220-0007,it now contained only chanticleer his two wives and a solitary chicken
2086-149220-0008,it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure
2086-149220-0009,these feathered people had existed too long in their distinct variety a fact of which the present representatives judging by their lugubrious deportment seemed to be aware
2086-149220-0010,they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched a chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls
2086-149220-0011,the distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth in these latter days but so oddly and wickedly analogous to hepzibah's turban that phoebe to the poignant distress of her conscience but inevitably was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative
2086-149220-0012,the chicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran with some show of liveliness to her feet while chanticleer and the ladies of his household regarded her with queer sidelong glances and then croaked one to another as if communicating their sage opinions of her character
2086-149220-0013,so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the idea not merely that they were the descendants of a time honored race but that they had existed in their individual capacity ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny
2086-149220-0014,he held a hoe in his hand and while phoebe was gone in quest of the crumbs had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the roots of the tomatoes
2086-149220-0015,they have known me much longer but never honor me with any familiarity though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food
2086-149220-0016,miss hepzibah i suppose will interweave the fact with her other traditions and set it down that the fowls know you to be a pyncheon
2086-149220-0017,ah but these hens answered the young man these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn yard fowl
2086-149220-0018,i prefer to think and so would miss hepzibah that they recognize the family tone for you are a pyncheon
2086-149220-0019,my name is phoebe pyncheon said the girl with a manner of some reserve for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the daguerreotypist of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea
2086-149220-0020,i turn up the earth by way of pastime
2086-149220-0021,it is like a bandage over one's eyes to come into it
2086-149220-0022,if you would permit me said the artist looking at phoebe i should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
2086-149220-0023,most of my likenesses do look unamiable but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the originals are so
2086-149220-0024,there is a wonderful insight in heaven's broad and simple sunshine
2086-149220-0025,while we give it credit only for depicting the merest surface it actually brings out the secret character with a truth that no painter would ever venture upon even could he detect it
2086-149220-0026,yet the original wears to common eyes a very different expression
2086-149220-0027,he exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case
2086-149220-0028,phoebe merely glanced at it and gave it back
2086-149220-0029,i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet
2086-149220-0030,the sun as you see tells quite another story and will not be coaxed out of it after half a dozen patient attempts on my part
2086-149220-0031,here we have the man sly subtle hard imperious and withal cold as ice look at that eye
2086-149220-0032,and yet if you could only see the benign smile of the original
2086-149220-0033,well i don't wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait
2086-149220-0034,if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard
2086-149220-0035,is there nothing wild in the eye continued holgrave so earnestly that it embarrassed phoebe as did also the quiet freedom with which he presumed on their so recent acquaintance
2086-149220-0036,it is nonsense said phoebe a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen
2086-149220-0037,since you are a friend of my cousin hepzibah's you should ask her to show you the picture
2086-149220-0038,so we will be fellow laborers somewhat on the community system
2086-149220-0039,she did not altogether like him
2086-149220-0040,oh rejoined the daguerreotypist because like an old lady's cup of tea it is water bewitched
2086-149220-0041,she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards a corner
2086-149220-0042,but put it on the table in the corner of the passage
2086-149220-0043,what an instrument is the human voice
2086-149220-0044,how wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul
2086-149220-0045,fewer words than before but with the same mysterious music in them
2086-149220-0046,pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest
2086-149220-0047,i will sit in the parlor awhile and collect my thoughts
2086-149220-0048,while thus dismissing her the maiden lady stept forward kissed phoebe and pressed her to her heart which beat against the girl's bosom with a strong high and tumultuous swell
2086-149220-0049,at some uncertain period in the depths of night and as it were through the thin veil of a dream she was conscious of a footstep mounting the stairs heavily but not with force and decision
777-126732-0000,all idealisation makes life poorer
777-126732-0001,then why indulge in prophetic phantasies
777-126732-0002,at best they can only interpret the mind of the prophet and can have no objective value
777-126732-0003,michaelis the ticket of leave apostle was speaking in an even voice a voice that wheezed as if deadened and oppressed by the layer of fat on his chest
777-126732-0004,and ever since he had never managed to get his weight down as much as an ounce
777-126732-0005,with his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint but more like a bend in a dummy's limb thrown over the back of a chair he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate
777-126732-0006,yes i had the time to think things out a little he added without emphasis
777-126732-0007,when he rose painfully the thrusting forward of a skinny groping hand deformed by gouty swellings suggested the effort of a moribund murderer summoning all his remaining strength for a last stab
777-126732-0008,his enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger
777-126732-0009,the old terrorist turned slowly his head on his skinny neck from side to side
777-126732-0010,and i could never get as many as three such men together
777-126732-0011,the possessors of property had not only to face the awakened proletariat but they had also to fight amongst themselves yes
777-126732-0012,struggle warfare was the condition of private ownership it was fatal
777-126732-0013,ah he did not depend upon emotional excitement to keep up his belief no declamations no anger no visions of blood red flags waving or metaphorical lurid suns of vengeance rising above the horizon of a doomed society not he
777-126732-0014,don't you think that if i had not been the optimist i am i could not have found in fifteen years some means to cut my throat
777-126732-0015,a harsh laugh from comrade ossipon cut the tirade dead short in a sudden faltering of the tongue and a bewildered unsteadiness of the apostle's mildly exalted eyes
777-126732-0016,alexander ossipon got up tall in his threadbare blue serge suit under the low ceiling shook off the stiffness of long immobility and strolled away into the kitchen down two steps to look over stevie's shoulder
777-126732-0017,very characteristic perfectly typical
777-126732-0018,you would call that lad a degenerate would you mumbled mister verloc
777-126732-0019,it was karl yundt who was heard implacable to his last breath
777-126732-0020,lombroso is an ass
777-126732-0021,for him the criminal is the prisoner simple is it not
777-126732-0022,there was an extraordinary force of suggestion in this posturing
777-126732-0023,the famous terrorist had never in his life raised personally as much as his little finger against the social edifice
777-126732-0024,the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison emptied now useless ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time
777-126732-0025,michaelis the ticket of leave apostle smiled vaguely with his glued lips his pasty moon face drooped under the weight of melancholy assent
777-126732-0026,he had been a prisoner himself
777-126732-0027,his own skin had sizzled under the red hot brand he murmured softly
777-126732-0028,you don't understand he began disdainfully but stopped short intimidated by the dead blackness of the cavernous eyes in the face turned slowly towards him with a blind stare as if guided only by the sound
777-126732-0029,he gave the discussion up with a slight shrug of the shoulders
777-126732-0030,stevie accustomed to move about disregarded had got up from the kitchen table carrying off his drawing to bed with him
777-126732-0031,the sheet of paper covered with circles dropped out of his fingers and he remained staring at the old terrorist as if rooted suddenly to the spot by his morbid horror and dread of physical pain
777-126732-0032,his scared eyes blazed with indignation it would hurt terribly his mouth dropped open
777-126732-0033,comrade ossipon's face twitched with exasperation
777-126732-0034,i don't say that protested michaelis gently
777-126732-0035,his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time
777-126732-0036,the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash and michaelis the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary got up impetuously
777-126732-0037,the disdainful pout of comrade ossipon's thick lips accentuated the negro type of his face
777-126732-0038,he paused then added with modest firmness
777-126732-0039,i would call it cannibalistic that's what it is
777-126732-0040,they are nourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the people nothing else
777-126732-0041,stevie swallowed the terrifying statement with an audible gulp and at once as though it had been swift poison sank limply in a sitting posture on the steps of the kitchen door
777-126732-0042,he closed the door behind their backs with restrained violence turned the key shot the bolt
777-126732-0043,he was not satisfied with his friends
777-126732-0044,with the insight of a kindred temperament he pronounced his verdict
777-126732-0045,there are natures too to whose sense of justice the price exacted looms up monstrously enormous odious oppressive worrying humiliating extortionate intolerable those are the fanatics
777-126732-0046,in any case he had not the time
777-126732-0047,loafing was all very well for these fellows who knew not mister vladimir and had women to fall back upon whereas he had a woman to provide for
777-126732-0048,these were but few and for the first time since he opened his shop he took a commercial survey of its value
777-126732-0049,this survey was unfavourable
777-126732-0050,he took the cash box out of the drawer and turning to leave the shop became aware that stevie was still downstairs
777-126732-0051,he looked dubiously at his brother in law but he did not ask him for information
777-126732-0052,mister verloc perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie
777-126732-0053,he stood still in the middle of the parlour and looked into the kitchen in silence
777-126732-0054,he watched him gesticulating and murmuring in the kitchen
777-126732-0055,stevie prowled round the table like an excited animal in a cage
777-126732-0056,the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plaits for the night
777-126732-0057,her bare feet as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned sleeved calico sack buttoned tightly at neck and wrists felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husband's face
777-126732-0058,there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police
777-126732-0059,it's like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plain
777-126732-0060,the comparison occurred to mister verloc because he had sat astride various army horses in his time and had now the sensation of an incipient fall
777-126732-0061,the prospect was as black as the window pane against which he was leaning his forehead
777-126732-0062,yes not at all well
777-126732-0063,down below in the quiet narrow street measured footsteps approached the house then died away unhurried and firm as if the passer by had started to pace out all eternity from gas lamp to gas lamp in a night without end and the drowsy ticking of the old clock on the landing became distinctly audible in the bedroom
777-126732-0064,that poor boy is in a very excited state to night she murmured after a pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock
777-126732-0065,this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed
777-126732-0066,there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head
777-126732-0067,mister verloc's anxieties had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying
